--- Original Description ---
My first RimWorld mod wooh!

This mods adds:

-Methamphetamine, a stimulant that is similar to wake-up, but is much stronger and has a euphoric effect, it is also much more dangerous and addictive.

-BlueIce, a cheaper to make version of the stimulant methamphetamine, it is slightly weaker. The dangers still persist however. (Update 1)

-Methylamine, the ingredient necessary to make BlueIce, it is more expensive than Neutroamine needed for methamphetamine, however, half the amount is needed, and it is usually sold in much higher amounts. (Update 1)

-4-methylcarboxylamine, Mouthful isn't it? This is by far the most powerful stimulant ever made. It was made by scientists on a planet colonized specifically for medical research, it was supposed to be a drug with similar uses to wake-up, but less addictive. What they made instead is a drug more addictive than anything else in the universe. A drug so complex to make that it is incredibly rare to come by, and comes with a hefty price. (Update 3)

A lot of people have said methamphetamine was already in Rimworld, saying it is insert any vanilla drug here.
No drug in this game accurately represents the drug, so please don't comment that.

My first mod for Rimworld, be nice guys ;)
